  Use when authoring, editing, reviewing, or publishing any Sigma workbook
  or dashboard JSON spec in this repo — including whenever the user says
  "start build mode", mentions Sigma workbooks, dashboards, or specs, asks
  to build/edit/POST/PUT a workbook, references data models, KPIs, charts,
  tables, controls, layouts, filters, maps, or the `/v2/workbooks/spec`
  endpoint. Encodes project conventions on element naming, page/folder
  layout, ID semantics on POST/PUT, secret handling, and common pitfalls
  when generating Sigma JSON specs. Pair with `sigma-data-models` for
  field-level reference, and with a domain-specific workbook-pattern
  skill when one is available for the dashboard type being built.

# Sigma Workbook Conventions

Project-wide conventions for Sigma workbook/data-model specs. Read this before
generating or editing any `spec.json` in `workbooks/` or `examples/`.

## Inputs

This skill is reference-only — no scripts. It assumes:

- Sigma auth is bootstrapped by the repo-local `scripts/api/_env.sh`
  (see "Auth is auto-bootstrapped" below). The upstream `sigma-api`
  plugin is optional — used only when `SIGMA_TOKEN_FETCHER` points at
  its `get-token.sh`.
- `sigma-data-models` is available for endpoint mechanics and field semantics.
- The local mirror at `vendor/sigma-agent-skills/` is available to consult when a
  field-level question isn't answered here.

## Session kickoff

Sessions start with a 3-question `AskUserQuestion` gate. The user can trigger
it explicitly with `start build mode`, or it fires implicitly on any prompt
that asks to build/edit/POST a Sigma workbook. The gate captures the raw
inputs the planner needs; the plan-first workflow (below) is what
authorizes any state-changing API call.

### The 3-question kickoff

The very first action of a build-mode session is `AskUserQuestion` with three
questions. Each question has a defined branch behavior:

**Q1: Is your `.env` set up?**

- **Yes** — Claude runs two actions in sequence to verify auth end-to-end:
  1. `bash scripts/api/_env.sh` — warms the token cache at a per-user `$SIGMA_TOKEN_CACHE` path (55-min TTL).
  2. `scripts/api/whoami.sh` — actively probes `/v2/files?limit=5` to confirm the token works against the live API and surfaces 5 recent files the user can confirm visually.

  Why both: passive bootstrap (`_env.sh`) succeeds even when credentials are wrong as long as `.env` has the variables filled in. The active `whoami` probe catches expired clients, wrong region URLs, and revoked tokens *before* recon starts — not mid-build.

- **No** — Claude shares `.env.example` contents + a link to Sigma's "Administration → Developer Access" docs for OAuth client creation, then re-prompts Q1 once the user confirms setup.

**Q2: What data source will you build against?**
- Data model URL/slug (`Customer-Financials-461QUZu2VPny8KxImgSmfF`)
- Warehouse table path (`<CONN>.<DB>.<SCHEMA>.<TABLE>` or `/t/<id>` URL)
- Mixed prose (the resolver handles it)

**Q3: What would you like to build, and where would you like the workbook placed in Sigma?**

Free-text. Captured verbatim as the prompt-of-record and written to
`workbooks/<name>/prompts/<timestamp>.md`. The "where" portion captures the
destination folder URL/slug/name at the kickoff layer, so the planner doesn't
have to re-ask. If the user doesn't name a destination here, the plan must
surface it as an Open Decision before POST — destination is never silently
defaulted.

### Worked example — what a build-mode kickoff looks like

```
User: start build mode

Claude: [calls AskUserQuestion with Q1, Q2, Q3 above]

  Q1 → Yes
Claude: [bash scripts/api/_env.sh]
        [scripts/api/whoami.sh]
        → "Authenticated to api.sigmacomputing.com. Recent files: ..."

  Q2 → "Customer-Financials-461QUZu2VPny8KxImgSmfF data model"
  Q3 → "customer profitability + attrition workbook in
        Claude-Testing-3Kzaga67BMlB7vVJQksjlX folder"

Claude: [writes the verbatim prompt to workbooks/<name>/prompts/<ts>.md]
        [resolves URL slugs via scripts/api/find-file-by-urlid.sh]
        [enters Recon — mcp-describe.sh on the data model]
        [drafts the Plan, surfaces for user approval]
```

If `whoami.sh` returns non-zero, the agent surfaces the Sigma error verbatim
and stops — does NOT continue into Recon with broken auth.

### Plan-first reaffirmation

The kickoff captures **raw inputs**. It does NOT replace the plan-first workflow.

After the kickoff, the agent proceeds through Recon → Plan proposal → User approval → Build → GET-back → Visual verify, per `docs/iteration-playbook.md`. **Plan approval is the only authorization for state-changing API calls** (POST/PUT to `/v2/workbooks/spec`, `/v2/dataModels/*/spec`). The 3-gate does not pre-authorize anything except the auth warm-up itself.

### Optional: session-local enrichment via `local-` prefix

To add project-specific context (Tableau migration notes, account-specific
exemplars, industry patterns) directly to the skill, use a **`local-`
filename prefix** on the added file — e.g. `reference/local-tableau-migration.md`
or `examples/local-cohort-tableau-port.json`. The prefix stays at the same
directory level as canonical files so partial reads surface it, and
`ls reference/local-*` lists every enrichment cleanly. Optionally open the
file with a banner (`> **Local enrichment** — <date>, <purpose>`) so future
readers know it's opt-in, not canonical.

## Discovery: use the bash helpers

Read-only discovery against the Sigma workspace routes through the bash
helpers in `scripts/api/`. Full protocol — routing table
(name/URL/messy-prose), MCP-vs-REST fallback, `mcp-describe` batching
rules, resolver JSON shape, friendly-vs-raw column-name normalization,
troubleshooting — lives in `reference/workflows/discover.md`. Load it
before any recon step.

For Sigma **function references** and **REST API endpoint shapes** (not
workspace discovery), use the native `mcp__claude_ai_Sigma_Docs__*`
tools instead. See `reference/specification/formulas.md` → "Looking up
Sigma functions."

### Auth is auto-bootstrapped

Each `scripts/api/*.sh` sources `_env.sh` on first call — loads `.env`
(or reads already-exported `SIGMA_*` env vars, e.g. in Claude Code web
sessions), mints an OAuth token via the repo-local
`scripts/api/get-token.sh` (a self-contained `client_credentials`
exchange against `/v2/auth/token`), and caches it at a per-user path
under `$SIGMA_TOKEN_CACHE` (mode 0600, 55-min TTL). Callers pass no env vars,
no tokens. **CLI and web run identical code** — the skill owns auth
end-to-end rather than delegating to the upstream `sigma-api` plugin
(which isn't installed in web sessions opened from a downloaded zip).
Override the fetcher via `SIGMA_TOKEN_FETCHER=/abs/path/to/get-token.sh`
if you want to point at the plugin's fetcher or a custom one.

### Installing this skill in a new project

When dropping this skill into another project, merge the rules in
`recommended-permissions.json` (alongside this `SKILL.md`) into that
project's `.claude/settings.json` under `permissions`. With those rules
in place, every script in `scripts/api/*` runs without an approval
prompt; `curl` calls for workbook authoring/publishing still prompt
(by design — they're state-changing).

### Invoking scripts — workspace-level, not skill-bundled

Scripts live at the **workspace root** (`scripts/`, `scripts/api/`), not
inside this skill's folder. This is intentional: the same scripts are
shared across every skill and workbook in this workspace, so bundling
them per-skill would fork identical code across skills. When the
workspace root is your working directory, invoke `scripts/api/*.sh` and
`python3 scripts/*.py` **bare** — no `cd <repo> &&` prefix needed. The
`Bash(scripts/api/*)` allowlist pattern matches bare invocations and
runs silent; prepending `cd` defeats the pattern match, adds verbosity,
and creates no functional benefit.

## Sources of truth

This skill is verified-from-incident recipes + gotchas layered on top of
two authoritative sources:

1. **Sigma OpenAPI** — canonical schema for every request/response shape
   and field. `https://help.sigmacomputing.com/openapi/sigma-computing-public-rest-api.json`
2. **Existing workbooks on the user's org** — concrete working specs,
   accessible via `GET /v2/workbooks/{id}/spec` (or via
   `scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh get-spec <wb-id>`).

**When this skill and the OpenAPI disagree, the OpenAPI wins.** For the
`jq` recipes to fetch and inspect the OpenAPI, and the schema-drift
fallback protocol, see `reference/specification/schema.md` → "Consulting
the OpenAPI" and "Schema-drift signal."

## Spec format — JSON or YAML

The Sigma API accepts both `application/json` and `application/yaml`
on `POST /v2/workbooks/spec`. **This skill's tooling defaults to JSON**
— all canonical exemplars in `examples/` are `.json`,
`scripts/validate-spec.py` reads JSON, `scripts/workbook-manifest.py`
reads JSON, `scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh` doesn't care.

YAML is fine for hand-authoring and the upstream `sigma-workbooks`
skill prefers it for human readability. If you receive a YAML spec
from a user or upstream tool, convert via `yq -o=json` or PyYAML
before running this skill's validators. Don't migrate existing JSON
exemplars to YAML — the tooling expects JSON and a mixed-format
`examples/` directory is harder to maintain.

## Workflow: propose a plan before building

### Required reading before authoring (HARD GATE)

Before writing ANY spec content, `Read` the chunk files mapped to the
task type below. This is not optional, and not a "scan the index then
proceed." The agent must `Read` the actual chunk files in the current
session and cite chunk + section in the plan.

| Task type | Required chunks |
|---|---|
| Every build (always) | `reference/conventions.md` + `reference/workflows/plan.md` + `reference/workflows/composition.md` + `reference/specification/schema.md` + `reference/specification/layout.md` |
| Viz-heavy build (>2 chart kinds, KPI rows, pivots) | + each `reference/specification/<kind>.md` for the kinds in the plan (`charts.md`, `kpis.md`, `tables.md`, etc.) |
| Formula-heavy build (custom calcs, metrics, Lookup, Rollup) | + `reference/specification/formulas.md` |
| Conditional-formatting build (table/pivot cell coloring) | + `reference/specification/tables.md` |
| Container-styling-heavy build | + `reference/specification/containers.md` |
| Image / divider / embed / dynamic-text build | + `reference/specification/others.md` + `reference/specification/text.md` |
| Map-bearing build (`geography-map`, `point-map`, `region-map`) | + `reference/specification/maps.md` |
| Round-trip / edge-case work (POST failures, format fields, axis controls) | + `reference/scope-and-edge-cases.md` + `reference/workflows/validate.md` + `reference/capability-ledger.md` |
| Deciding whether a feature is "supported" (before writing any "not supported" claim) | + `reference/capability-ledger.md` → the retest protocol, first |
| From-image build (screenshot / mockup reproduction) | + `reference/workflows/from-image.md` (load BEFORE data discovery) |

If chunks are skipped, the agent is operating on memory of prior sessions —
which is exactly how the 2026-05-19 regression happened (passthrough collapse +
metric carryover across DM switch). See `reference/history.md`.

The plan output (per the next section) must include a `Chunks Read:`
line listing the files consulted. A plan without that line is incomplete
and not approvable. Full plan-first methodology in
`reference/workflows/plan.md`.

### Plan content

Workbook prompts often underspecify the dashboard — the user names the data
and the question, not the visualizations or the filter set. Do not jump
straight to JSON. Before authoring any spec, surface a written plan and
wait for explicit approval.

The plan must include:

1. **Destination.** Where the workbook (or data-model update) will be
   published — folder `name` + `path` + `urlId`, resolved from the
   user's prompt via `sigma-resolve.py`. If the user named a folder
   inline, restate it back so they can correct it. If the user did NOT
   name a folder, this becomes an Open Decision (item 6) the plan must
   ask, not a default the agent picks. **Plan approval IS the
   authorization to POST/PUT** — there is no separate "are you sure?"
   prompt at publish time. The destination must therefore be named
   explicitly in the plan, never implied.
2. **Data inventory.** What table(s) and which columns are actually
   available — pulled via `scripts/api/mcp-describe.sh datamodel-element
   <dm-id> <el-id>` (returns column types, descriptions, formulas, and
   the data model's metrics catalog), not assumed. Name any column
   that's missing from your assumed schema (e.g. there *is* a customer
   dimension; there *isn't* a margin field) so the user can correct
   before you build on a wrong premise.
3. **Inference rationale.** For each visualization you propose, one line
   on *why this chart, this dimension, this metric* answers the user's
   question. "Quantity, not revenue, because popularity is a unit-volume
   question" beats "bar chart of products."
4. **Filter set with reasoning.** Filters aren't free — each one earns
   its place by mapping to an axis the user is likely to interrogate.
   List the filters in priority order with a one-line reason, and note
   what you considered and dropped.
5. **Layout sketch.** A textual block-diagram of the page is enough
   (header / KPI row / chart grid / detail). Don't draw the XML yet.
6. **Open decisions.** Anywhere you had to guess (proxy for a missing
   dimension, scope of demographic data to bring in, whether to modify a
   shared data model, **missing/ambiguous destination folder**). Phrase
   as questions the user can yes/no.

Only after the user approves should you write spec JSON. This convention
exists because rebuilding a wrong dashboard costs more iterations than
the 60 seconds spent writing the plan, and because the user can correct
data-model assumptions you'd otherwise discover at POST time.

If the user has already given you an explicit plan, skip to building —
don't re-propose.

### Approval model — plan is the only gate

Plan approval authorizes **every state-changing API call covered by the
plan, except DELETE**. POST/PUT to `/v2/workbooks/spec` and
`/v2/dataModels/*/spec` run silently — `.claude/settings.json` allowlists
both `Bash(scripts/api/*)` (which covers `publish-workbook.sh`) and the
direct curl patterns. The user reviews one plan, approves, and the
build + publish proceed without further interruption.

The rules:

- **POST/PUT inside the workbook/data-model namespace:** silent. Plan
  approval is the authorization.
- **POST/PUT outside that namespace** (e.g. `/v2/connections`,
  `/v2/files` mutations): not pre-authorized — surface to the user.
- **DELETE on any endpoint:** always asks. The `ask` patterns in
  `.claude/settings.json` (`Bash(curl * -X DELETE *)` and
  `Bash(scripts/api/delete-*)`) override the broad `Bash(scripts/api/*)`
  allow. Even when the plan mentions deletion, every DELETE call is
  surfaced for explicit confirmation.

That contract puts the burden on the agent:

- The plan needs to name the destination folder (item 1 above) and
  any shared object it intends to mutate (data models, exemplars) —
  the `publish-workbook.sh` wrapper can't resolve where to POST
  without an explicit destination. If a state-changing call wasn't
  covered in the plan, don't make it — amend the plan first.
- Any future deletion-wrapper script must be named `scripts/api/delete-*`
  so the ask pattern catches it. Do not bypass via a different name.

## Conventions

### Naming

- **Pages** use Title Case ("Variance Detail", not "variance_detail" or "variance detail").
- **Columns** use snake_case for IDs and Title Case for display labels.
- **Metrics** start with a verb: `total_revenue`, `count_orders`, `avg_ticket`. Display labels stay human-readable ("Total Revenue").
- **Filters/Controls** are named after the dimension they bind to, suffixed with `_filter` or `_control`.
- Avoid Sigma's auto-generated names (`Calculation 1`, `Filter 2`); always rename before saving an iteration.

### Page/folder layout

- First page = **Overview** (KPI tiles + a single primary visualization).
- Subsequent pages drill from coarse → fine: Overview → Trend → Detail → Exception list.
- Group related controls into a single Filter Bar at the top of each page rather than scattering.
- Use folder groupings for any model with >10 elements; flat models are hard to read.

### ID semantics

Workbook spec IDs (pages, elements, columns) are **preserved verbatim**
on POST/PUT. Use stable human-readable IDs (`col-revenue`,
`page-overview`, `tbl-transactions-master`) and reuse them across
iterations. Layout `elementId` references stay valid across POST/PUT.

Verified 2026-07-02: skill-authored workbooks retain 100% of their
kebab-case IDs after POST → GET round-trip. See
`reference/specification/schema.md` → "ID rules" and
`reference/workflows/crud.md` → "ID preservation on CREATE."

Note: `sigma-data-models` (data model round-trip endpoint) has its own
ID semantics and is separate from this workbook-spec behavior.

### Constraints (from upstream `sigma-data-models`)

- Partial updates are NOT supported — both CREATE and UPDATE require the complete spec.
- A single model cannot contain multiple identically-named tables.
- Python elements, and references to other Sigma elements in custom
  SQL are **not supported** by the *data-model* round-trip endpoints
  (`sigma-data-models` skill scope). Avoid generating these in a data-model spec.
  **Correction (2026-08-03):** this line previously also named input tables,
  which read as a blanket prohibition and contradicted
  `reference/specification/tables.md` → "Input tables". Input tables are a
  *workbook* spec element (`kind: "input-table"`), not a data-model
  construct — they are fully supported, verified via clean GET-spec
  (HTTP 200) against 5 real production workbooks holding 27 input-table
  instances combined. See `reference/capability-ledger.md`. This
  constraint is scoped to data-model round-trip only.

### Secrets

- Never bake `$SIGMA_API_TOKEN`, `$SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET`, or any credential into a
  spec, prompt, or note file.
- Do not write tokens to files under the workspace.
- Tokens belong only in the `Authorization` header.

### Iteration hygiene

- Save each generation attempt under `workbooks/<name>/iterations/<timestamp>.json`
  alongside the prompt that produced it in `prompts/<timestamp>.md`. This makes
  diffs across attempts cheap and turns each session into evidence.
- When a fix recurs across 2+ iterations, promote the rule into this file or into
  a domain skill's `reference/`. See `docs/iteration-playbook.md`.

## Load-bearing rules — always-loaded summary

Four rules carry most of the round-trip failures from prior sessions.
Inline here as one-line summaries because they're too important to live
only in chunks. **Read `reference/conventions.md` for the full versions**
— required on every build per the hard gate above. These summaries are
insurance, not substitutes. **Always visually verify** the workbook in
the UI after a POST/PUT — the API doesn't validate cross-element column
resolution or visualization quality.

1. **Passthrough is mandatory.** Every viz element declares the full
   passthrough column set from its source table. The only carve-out is
   stripping a `Lookup`-derived column that produces a phantom series
   from that one viz — the exception is scoped to the specific viz;
   generalizing it to "no passthroughs anywhere" is what caused the
   2026-05-19 regression.
   `reference/conventions.md` → "Passthrough mandate."
2. **`[Metrics/<Name>]` resolution + DM-switch hard rule.** Metrics
   resolve against the data-model element a spec sources from. On any
   data-model switch mid-session, re-derive every `[Metrics/...]` from
   the new recon — carrying metrics forward from a previous DM's plan
   invalidates them silently, and the resulting POST fails at render
   without any spec-level error.
   `reference/conventions.md` → "`[Metrics/<Name>]` resolution +
   DM-switch hard rule."
3. **Inference anchor — every formula traces to recon.** Every formula
   in a plan must trace to a `[Metrics/X]` in the recon catalog OR a
   column declared on the recon-confirmed source. "Reasonable
   assumption" formulas are forbidden; missing fields surface as Open
   Decisions. `reference/conventions.md` → "Inference anchor."
4. **Control/column ID collision.** A control's `controlId` must NOT
   match any column `name` or `id` on filtered elements. `[Date]`
   resolves to the control before the column when names collide;
   downstream `Month([Date])` silently breaks.
   `reference/conventions.md` → "Control/column ID collision."

The deeper edge-case checklist (explicit-`name`, rename-cascade,
bar-chart orientation, summary-bar, two-tier sourcing) lives in
`reference/conventions.md`. The 4 rules above are the ones that, when
violated, ship a broken workbook.

## Publishing

Use `scripts/api/publish-workbook.sh` for POST / PUT / GET / metadata —
it auto-runs `validate-spec.py` before writes, injects auth, 401-retries
via `sigma_curl`, and auto-runs `audit-workbook-schema.sh` after every
successful POST/PUT to catch `error`-typed columns that
`verify-workbook.sh` misses. Full subcommand reference, DELETE via
direct-curl, and the response-only-fields-to-strip list live in
`reference/workflows/crud.md`.

## Reference and examples

`reference/` is split into three groups. Load only what the current task
needs — see "Required reading before authoring" above for the hard-gate
mapping.

**Top-level orchestration:**

- `reference/conventions.md` — the ryan-specific cross-cutting rules
  (passthrough mandate, drill-down corollary, explicit-`name` rule,
  rename-cascade corollary, `[Metrics/<Name>]` resolution + DM-switch
  hard rule, control/column ID collision, bar-chart orientation,
  summary-bar pattern, two-tier sourcing, notes-promotion guardrail).
  **Required on every build.**
- `reference/scope-and-edge-cases.md` — what the code spec does NOT
  represent (KPI period-comparison, chart series colors / theme
  palette, pivot heatmap status, axis-label rotation), GET-spec 500
  cases, warehouse-table fallback, verifying via generated SQL.
- `reference/history.md` — dated incident log. Inline rules in the
  chunks are evergreen; this file carries when each rule was verified
  and the incident that surfaced it.
- `reference/naming.md` — naming rubric (columns, metrics, controls,
  pages) — style guide, not load-bearing.

**Workflow files (`reference/workflows/`):**

- `plan.md` — the 6-section plan format, `Chunks Read:` requirement,
  plan-is-the-only-gate approval model. **Required on every build.**
- `composition.md` — design judgment, not spec shape: the sizing ladder
  (single thing / focused view / dashboard), when to stop and ask, three
  defaults (hidden base tables, sort ranked tables by the ranked metric,
  never expose intermediate joins), and surfacing structural choices in
  the build summary. Ported 2026-08-03 from the real upstream
  `sigma-workbooks` skill. **Required on every build.**
- `crud.md` — POST/GET/PUT mechanics + ID preservation on POST +
  response-only fields to strip on PUT + the `publish-workbook.sh`
  wrapper.
- `discover.md` — `mcp-search.sh` / `mcp-describe.sh` sequencing,
  REST fallbacks, friendly-vs-raw warehouse name normalization.
- `validate.md` — `validate-spec.py` (pre-submit, 14 checks) +
  `verify-workbook.sh` (SQL-compile check) +
  `audit-workbook-schema.sh` (data-layer schema audit, auto-run by
  `publish-workbook.sh`) + cryptic-error decoding table.
- `from-image.md` — image-to-spec workflow (screenshot, mockup,
  PDF, BI-tool export). Load BEFORE data discovery when the user
  supplies a target image.

**Specification files (`reference/specification/`):**

Per-element-kind recipes + gotchas. Each file opens with the relevant
OpenAPI `jq` recipe.

- `schema.md` — top-level workbook spec shape, response-only fields,
  ID preservation on POST, top-level `folders` + `themeOverrides` +
  `theme` element kind, minimal working example.
- `formulas.md` — formula DSL: column-reference rules,
  `[Metrics/<X>]`, boolean operators trap (`Not` requires space),
  JSON dot notation, window functions, `&` for string concat.
- `formatting.md` — d3-format + strftime cheat sheets, SI prefix
  currency.
- `layout.md` — top-level layout XML (24-col grid), XML-vs-object
  `layout` distinction, `<GridContainer>` vs `<LayoutElement>`
  silent failure, `gridTemplateRows` normalization quirk,
  page-structure pattern.
- `containers.md` — `kind: container` + `style` (bg + border) +
  `backgroundImage` (object with fit/align/tiling), 5-recipe catalog.
- `charts.md` — bar/line/area/combo/scatter/pie/donut + canonical
  `columnId`/`columnIds` axis shape + `refMarks` + `trendlines` +
  `dataLabel`/`seriesDataLabel` + 3-variant `color` channel
  (single/category/scale) + `top-n` filter fields + `gap` for bar
  spacing.
- `kpis.md` — `kpi-chart` shape (`value.columnId`), sparkline via
  date dimension, styled-name object form, element-level `layout`
  object (`anchor`), polymorphic `description`, no-delta limitation.
- `tables.md` — `table` + `pivot-table` + `input-table` (minimal) +
  `conditionalFormats` (4 variants) + `tableStyle` +
  `tableComponents` + styled-name + `noDataText` + `summary` bar.
- `controls.md` — 11 accepted controlTypes (`list`, `date-range`,
  `date`, `text`, `text-area`, `number`, `number-range`, `slider`,
  `range-slider`, `toggle`/`switch`/`checkbox`, `segmented`,
  `hierarchy`) + 8 date-range modes + `top-n` filter + multi-binding
  patterns + control/column collision reference. Note:
  `controlType: "dropdown"` / `"radio"` currently POST-reject; use
  `list + selectionMode: "single"` instead.
- `text.md` — Markdown subset + inline HTML (color, font-size,
  single-family font, paragraph alignment) + `{{formula}}` dynamic
  text embeds with d3 format suffix.
- `others.md` — `divider` (with `direction`/`align`/`style`) +
  `image` + `embed` elements + `{{formula}}` in URLs +
  buttons/modals unsupported note.
- `maps.md` — `geography-map` + `point-map` + `region-map` (with
  `regionType` enum) + single-vs-array shape gotcha on binding
  fields.
- `sources-warehouse.md` — path formats per warehouse + formula
  prefixes + friendly-name normalization.
- `sources.md` — `table` / `data-model` / `join` / `union` / `sql` /
  `transpose` source kinds + two-tier sourcing pattern reference.
- `example-full.yaml` — multi-page reference spec (KPIs, charts, join
  sources, controls, custom layout) authored locally for this skill.
  **Correction (2026-08-03):** previously described as "verbatim ...
  from the upstream skill" — the real upstream `sigma-workbooks` skill
  (reviewed in full against a local copy of `sigma-agent-skills-dev`)
  contains no such file. That was a false attribution of external
  authority with no functional impact on the content itself, but it's
  the same bug class as the `DivideSafe` incident (`reference/history.md`)
  — a fabricated provenance claim rather than a fabricated function.
  Read this when in doubt about overall shape.

`examples/` — known-good specs to seed generation. Clone-and-modify rather
than editing in place. Match your task to the closest exemplar below;
`.prompt.md` sidecars (where present) describe the design intent.

- **Minimal / single-page:**
  - `data-model-sourced-overview.json` — smallest data-model-fed dashboard.
  - `data-model-sourced-single-page-inventory-health.json` (2026-07-02) — 10-element single-page dashboard with conditional formatting + two shared controls filtering multiple elements. Canonical minimal ops-triage exemplar. Paired with `.prompt.md`.
  - `dashboard-department-scorecard.json` (2026-08-03) — the "dashboard" tier of `reference/workflows/composition.md`'s sizing ladder: KPI row (period-comparison + timeline styling, modeled on a real production dashboard), one ranked chart and one ranked table both sorted by the metric they rank on, base table on a hidden page. **First exemplar to load for a plain read-only exec dashboard build with no interactive/writeback features.** Paired with `.prompt.md`.
- **Modern 3-page workbook (canonical):**
  - `data-model-sourced-sales-command-center.json` (2026-07-02) — 50-element 3-page workbook exercising every 2026-06/2026-07 skill fix (segmented control variants, `gap` safe default, distinct-column `holeValue`, KPI `value.columnId`, element `layout.anchor`, `themeOverrides`, styled `name`, card `style`, hierarchy control, `list + single`). Paired with `.prompt.md`. **First exemplar to load for any modern multi-page build.**
  - `data-model-sourced-exec-kpi-scorecard.json` (2026-07-02, post-fix) — 35-element exec-review workbook with pivot calculated PoP % delta column, US-state `region-map`, scatter for outlier detection, and two-tier anomaly-detection derived table (`groupings` + conditional-Sum, NOT `Rollup`). Paired with `.prompt.md`. Clone when the ask includes geographic viz or anomaly detection.
- **Catalog / kitchen-sink** (chart-kind + control-type coverage):
  - `data-model-sourced-multi-element-catalog.json` — 6 chart kinds, 3 KPIs, 4 control types, multi-level `groupings`.
  - `data-model-sourced-multi-level-aggregated-table.json` — combo-chart shape reference.
  - `additional-workbook-features-chart-and-control-catalog.json` — area stacking, pie chart, scatter.
- **Pattern-specific:**
  - `data-model-sourced-cohort-pivot.json` — two-tier sourcing (raw → derived) + `Rollup` + weeks-since-first-action pivot. Clone for cohort/retention.
  - `data-model-sourced-multi-page-profitability-attrition.json` — 4-page reference with per-page source tables + `Lookup()` demographic passthrough.
  - `styled-card-dashboard.json` — five-recipe element styling system (card framing, accent borders, subtle controls). Paired with `.prompt.md`.
- **Deprecated (kept for archaeological reference only):**
  - `data-model-sourced-kpi-overview-with-containers.json` — predates the 2026-07-02 KPI `value.columnId` fix + `controlId` collision rule. Do NOT clone verbatim; use `data-model-sourced-sales-command-center.json` instead.

For data-model field-level mechanics (columns, metrics, relationships,
filters, controls, formatting, folders, column-level security, workflows)
defer to the upstream `sigma-data-models` skill — its `reference/` folder is
the authoritative answer for those topics.
